      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h1>PREtirement Planning - Monte Carlo Projections</h1>
      <p><em>Your data stays with you. All computation is done on your browser and your data never leaves your device.</em></p>
      <h4>Fully configure your Monte Carlo simulations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>Unlimited time-bound income sources</h5>
          <p>
            Most retirement projections start from the retirement date.
            With PREtire, you can <b>configure as many income sources as you want across different dates</b>,
            so you can plan ahead whether you're just starting your career,
            considering a move to a slower-paced job,
            or ready to semi-retire before you give up work completely.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Plan for big purchases, sales, or other changes</h5>
          <p>
            Planning to sell your house in a couple years, then rent for a year, then maybe buy a bigger house?
            Plug all your planned sales, purchases, and changes to monthly expenses into the
            Life Events settings tab and see the projection graphs adjust to your plans.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li >
          <h5>Fully customize your asset allocation</h5>
          <p>
            Set up as many asset classes as you like, and make adjustments to the simulator even down to the standard deviation of each asset class.
          </p>
